# Custom-Football-Fixtures

Spreadsheet for creating a customised football fixtures report, covering the next week's games. It is focused on the top four English leagues, but will produce fixture lists from cup competitions and the Scottish leagues.

## Usage
There are three visible worksheets:
* Menu
* Fixtures Report
* Filter

On the Menu worksheet there are three buttons:
* **Get Data** - gets a list of fixtures from the web.
* **Clear Down Report** - clears down the report sheet so that a new report can be made.
* **Create Report / Add More Fixtures** - loads a form and adds fixtures to the report sheet
  
To use the spreadsheet, click on *Get Data* to get a list of imminent fixtures. *Create Report / Add More Fixtures* loads a form that prompts for Competition, Date, whether to use the filter (set to London teams only, but customisable), and whether to include the date in the report (i.e. if you want to display matches from multiple competitions on the same date you might not want to repeat that information in the report); this creates the report. 
  
### Customisable Filter

In the filter worksheet, cell A1 is the name of the filter, and the other cells below this are the contents of the filter. These can be changed to create any filter that is needed, as long as the team names in the filter match those used in the report.
